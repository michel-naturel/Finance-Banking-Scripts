# An Expenses Tracker created as a project on freeCodeCamp.
# It's a simple program using a user's input to store categorized expenses. The expenses dictionary is reset each time the code is run. Passing a letter
# instead of amount of money will cause an error.

# Defining a function add_expense that is adding a new entry to the dictionary - an amount and its category.
def add_expense(expenses, amount, category):
    expenses.append({'amount': amount, 'category': category})

# A function printing on the screen all the content from the dictionary named expenses.
def print_expenses(expenses):
    for expense in expenses:
        print(f'Amount: {expense["amount"]}, Category: {expense["category"]}')

# A function first creating a list of amounts taken from the dictionary, then summing them all up.
def total_expenses(expenses):
    return sum(map(lambda expense: expense['amount'], expenses))

# A function that shows all the expenses from certain category that is introduced by user.
def filter_expenses_by_category(expenses, category):
    return filter(lambda expense: expense['category'] == category, expenses)
    
# The main function. It creates a dictionary called expenses, shows up the menu and then lets a user choose the option.
